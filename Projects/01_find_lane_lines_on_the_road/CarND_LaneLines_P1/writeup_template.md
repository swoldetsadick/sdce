# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

## Project writeup

### This project writeup concludes the first three lessons of the first term of the self-driving car nano-degree program from Udacity, focused on fundamental in computer vision.

### The lessons revisit fundamental notions of computer vision, and this project make use of Python programming language and Python modules such as scikit learn and OpenCV to propose applications.

### Application is focused on detecting road lane lines via classical computer vision methods.

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to ...

Another potential improvement could be to ...
