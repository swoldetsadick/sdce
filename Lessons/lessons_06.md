### 4. A note on Deep Learning

**A Note on Deep Learning**

The following lessons contain introductory and intermediate material on neural networks, building a neural network from 
scratch, using TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks:

* Introduction to Neural Networks
* MiniFlow
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Deep Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks

While we highly suggest going through the all of the included content, if you already feel comfortable in any of these 
areas, feel free to skip ahead to later lessons. However, even if you have seen some of these topics before, it might be 
a good idea to get a refresher before you start working on the project!

### 7. Linear to Logistic Regression

**Linear to Logistic Regression**

Linear regression helps predict values on a continuous spectrum, like predicting what the price of a house will be.

How about classifying data among discrete classes?

Here are examples of classification tasks:

* Determining whether a patient has cancer
* Identifying the species of a fish
* Figuring out who's talking on a conference call

Classification problems are important for self-driving cars. Self-driving cars might need to classify whether an object 
crossing the road is a car, pedestrian, and a bicycle. Or they might need to identify which type of traffic sign is 
coming up, or what a stop light is indicating.

In the next video, Luis will demonstrate a classification algorithm called "logistic regression". He'll use logistic 
regression to predict whether a student will be accepted to a university.

Linear regression leads to logistic regression and ultimately neural networks, a more advanced classification tool.

### 8. Classification problems 1

**Classification Problems**

We'll start by defining what we mean by classification problems, and applying it to a simple example.
