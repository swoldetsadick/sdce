### 2. Introduction

In this lab, youâ€™ll build a library called MiniFlow which will be your own version of [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/)! (link for [China](http://tensorfly.cn/))

TensorFlow is one of the most popular open source neural network libraries, built by the team at Google Brain over just 
the last few years.

Following this lab, you'll spend the remainder of this module actually working with open-source deep learning libraries 
like [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). So why bother building MiniFlow? Good question, glad you asked!

The goal of this lab is to demystify two concepts at the heart of neural networks - backpropagation and differentiable 
graphs.

Backpropagation is the process by which neural networks update the weights of the network over time. (You may have seen 
it in [this video](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/83a4e710-a69e-4ce9-9af9-939307c0711b/concepts/4cc13714-37d7-4705-a714-314ede5290b5#) earlier.)

Differentiable graphs are graphs where the nodes are [differentiable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function). 
They are also useful as visual aids for understanding and calculating complicated derivatives. This is the fundamental 
abstraction of TensorFlow - it's a framework for creating differentiable graphs.

With graphs and backpropagation, you will be able to create your own nodes and properly compute the derivatives. Even 
more importantly, you will be able to think and reason in terms of these graphs.

Now, let's take the first peek under the hood...

### 3. Graphs

###### What is a Neural Network?

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/58375218_example-neural-network/example-neural-network.png)

A neural network is a graph of mathematical functions such as [linear combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination) 
and activation functions. The graph consists of **nodes**, and **edges**.

Nodes in each layer (except for nodes in the input layer) perform mathematical functions using inputs from nodes in the 
previous layers. For example, a node could represent f(x, y) = x + y, where x and y are input values from 
nodes in the previous layer.

Similarly, each node creates an output value which may be passed to nodes in the next layer. The output value from the 
output layer does not get passed to a future layer (because it is the final layer).

Layers between the input layer and the output layer are called **hidden layers**.

The edges in the graph describe the connections between the nodes, along which the values flow from one layer to the 
next. These edges can also apply operations to the values that flow along them, such as multiplying by weights and 
adding biases. MiniFlow won't use a separate class for edges - instead, its nodes will perform both their own 
calculations and those of their input edges. This will be more clear as you go through these lessons.

###### Forward Propagation

By propagating values from the first layer (the input layer) through all the mathematical functions represented by each 
node, the network outputs a value. This process is called a forward pass.

Here's an example of a simple **forward pass**.

[![forward pass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swoldetsadick/sdce/master/Lessons/images/07_01.PNG)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/carnd/videos/input-to-output-2.mp4 "forward pass")

Notice that the output layer performs a mathematical function, addition, on its inputs. There is no hidden layer.

###### Graphs

The nodes and edges create a graph structure. Though the example above is fairly simple, it isn't hard to imagine that 
increasingly complex graphs can calculate . . . well . . . almost anything.

There are generally two steps to create neural networks:

1. Define the graph of nodes and edges.
2. Propagate values through the graph.

```MiniFlow``` works the same way. You'll define the nodes and edges of your network with one method and then propagate values 
through the graph with another method. 

```MiniFlow``` comes with some starter code to help you out. We'll take a look on the 
next page, but first, let's test your intuition.

### 4. MiniFlow architecture

Let's consider how to implement this graph structure in ```MiniFlow```. We'll use a Python class to represent a generic 
node.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self):
        # Properties will go here!
````

We know that each node might receive input from multiple other nodes. We also know that each node creates a single 
output, which will likely be passed to other nodes. Let's add two lists: one to store references to the inbound nodes, 
and the other to store references to the outbound nodes.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Node(s) to which this Node passes values
        self.outbound_nodes = []
        # For each inbound_node, add the current Node as an outbound_node.
        for n in self.inbound_nodes:
            n.outbound_nodes.append(self)
````

Each node will eventually calculate a value that represents its output. Let's initialize the ```value``` to ```None``` 
to indicate that it exists but hasn't been set yet.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Node(s) to which this Node passes values
        self.outbound_nodes = []
        # For each inbound_node, add the current Node as an outbound_node.
        for n in self.inbound_nodes:
            n.outbound_nodes.append(self)
        # A calculated value
        self.value = None
````

Each node will need to be able to pass values forward and perform backpropagation (more on that later). For now, let's 
add a placeholder method for forward propagation. We'll deal with backpropagation later on.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Node(s) to which this Node passes values
        self.outbound_nodes = []
        # For each inbound_node, add the current Node as an outbound_node.
        for n in self.inbound_nodes:
            n.outbound_nodes.append(self)
        # A calculated value
        self.value = None

    def forward(self):
        """
        Forward propagation.

        Compute the output value based on `inbound_nodes` and
        store the result in self.value.
        """
        raise NotImplemented
````

###### Nodes that Calculate

While ```Node``` defines the base set of properties that every node holds, only specialized [subclasses]() of ```Node``` 
will end up in the graph. As part of this lab, you'll build the subclasses of ```Node``` that can perform calculations 
and hold values. For example, consider the ```Input``` subclass of ```Node```.

````python
class Input(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        # An Input node has no inbound nodes,
        # so no need to pass anything to the Node instantiator.
        Node.__init__(self)

    # NOTE: Input node is the only node where the value
    # may be passed as an argument to forward().
    #
    # All other node implementations should get the value
    # of the previous node from self.inbound_nodes
    #
    # Example:
    # val0 = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
    def forward(self, value=None):
        # Overwrite the value if one is passed in.
        if value is not None:
            self.value = value
````

Unlike the other subclasses of ```Node```, the ```Input``` subclass does not actually calculate anything. The ```Input``` 
subclass just holds a ```value```, such as a data feature or a model parameter (weight/bias).

You can set ```value``` either explicitly or with the ```forward()``` method. This value is then fed through the rest of 
the neural network.

###### The Add Subclass

```Add```, which is another subclass of ```Node```, actually can perform a calculation (addition).

````python
class Add(Node):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        Node.__init__(self, [x, y])

    def forward(self):
        """
        You'll be writing code here in the next quiz!
        """
````

Notice the difference in the ```__init__``` method, ```Add.__init__(self, [x, y])```. Unlike the ```Input``` class, 
which has no inbound nodes, the ```Add``` class takes 2 inbound nodes, ```x``` and ```y```, and adds the values of those 
nodes.

### 5. Forward propagation

```MiniFlow``` has two methods to help you define and then run values through your graphs: ```topological_sort()``` and 
```forward_pass()```.

In order to define your network, you'll need to define the order of operations for your nodes. Given that the input to 
some node depends on the outputs of others, you need to flatten the graph in such a way where all the input dependencies 
for each node are resolved before trying to run its calculation. This is a technique called a [topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swoldetsadick/sdce/master/Lessons/images/07_04.jpeg)

The ```topological_sort()``` function implements topological sorting using [Kahn's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn.27s_algorithm). The details of this method are 
not important, the result is; ```topological_sort()``` returns a sorted list of nodes in which all of the calculations 
can run in series. ```topological_sort()``` takes in a ```feed_dict```, which is how we initially set a value for an 
```Input``` node. The ```feed_dict``` is represented by the Python dictionary data structure. Here's an example use 
case:

````python
# Define 2 `Input` nodes.
x, y = Input(), Input()

# Define an `Add` node, the two above `Input` nodes being the input.
add = Add(x, y)

# The value of `x` and `y` will be set to 10 and 20 respectively.
feed_dict = {x: 10, y: 20}

# Sort the nodes with topological sort.
sorted_nodes = topological_sort(feed_dict=feed_dict)
````

(You can find the source code for ```topological_sort()``` in miniflow.py in the programming quiz below.)

The other method at your disposal is ```forward_pass()```, which actually runs the network and outputs a value.

````python
def forward_pass(output_node, sorted_nodes):
    """
    Performs a forward pass through a list of sorted nodes.

    Arguments:

        `output_node`: The output node of the graph (no outgoing edges).
        `sorted_nodes`: a topologically sorted list of nodes.

    Returns the output node's value
    """

    for n in sorted_nodes:
        n.forward()

    return output_node.value
````

###### Setup

Review ```nn.py``` and ```miniflow.py```.

The neural network architecture is already there for you in nn.py. It's your job to finish ```MiniFlow``` to make it work.

For this quiz, I want you to:

1. Open ```nn.py``` below. **You don't need to change anything**. I just want you to see how ```MiniFlow``` works.
2. Open ```miniflow.py```. **Finish the** ```forward``` **method on the** ```Add``` **class. All that's required to pass 
this quiz is a correct implementation of** ```forward```**.**
3. Test your network by hitting "Test Run!" When the output looks right, hit "Submit!"

(You'll find the solution on the next page.)

### 6. Forward propagation solution

Here's my solution (I'm just showing ```forward``` method of the ```Add``` class):

```
def forward(self):
    x_value = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
    y_value = self.inbound_nodes[1].value
    self.value = x_value + y_value
```

While this looks simple, I want to show you why I used ```x_value``` and ```y_value``` from the ```inbound_nodes``` 
array. Let's take a look at the start with ```Node```'s constructor:

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values.
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Removed everything else for brevity.
```

```inbound_nodes``` are set when the ```Node``` is instantiated.

Of course, you weren't using ```Node``` directly, rather you used ```Add```, which is a subclass of ```Node```. 
```Add```'s constructor is responsible for passing the ```inbound_nodes``` to ```Node```, which happens here:

```
class Add(Node):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
         Node.__init__(self, [x, y]) # calls Node's constructor
    ...
```

Lastly, there's the question of why ```node.value``` holds the value of the inputs. For each node of the ```Input()``` 
class, the nodes are set directly when you run ```topological_sort```:

```
def topological_sort(feed_dict):
    ...
    if isinstance(n, Input):
        n.value = feed_dict[n]
    ...
```

For other classes, the value of node.value is set in the forward pass:

```
def forward_pass(output_node, sorted_nodes):
    ...
    for n in sorted_nodes:
        n.forward()
    ...
```

And that's it for addition!

Keep going to make ```MiniFlow``` more capable.

###### Bonus Challenges!

These are **ungraded** challenges as they are more of a test of your Python skills than neural network skills.

2. Can you make a ```Mul``` class that multiplies _n_ inputs?

### 7. Learning and Loss

Like ```MiniFlow``` in its current state, neural networks take inputs and produce outputs. But unlike ```MiniFlow``` in its current 
state, neural networks can improve the accuracy of their outputs over time (it's hard to imagine improving the accuracy 
of ```Add``` over time!). To explore why accuracy matters, I want you to first implement a trickier (and more useful!) node

Think back to the Neural Networks lesson with Luis and Matt. A simple artificial neuron depends on three components:

* inputs, _x_ (vector)
* weights, _&#969;_ (vector)
* bias, _b_ (scalar)

The output, _o_, is just the weighted sum of the inputs plus the bias:

_o_ = &#8721;<sub>i</sub> _x_<sub>_i_</sub> &#8901; _&#969;_<sub>_i_</sub> + _b_

Equation (1)

Remember, by varying the weights, you can vary the amount of influence any given input has on the output. The learning 
aspect of neural networks takes place during a process known as backpropagation. In backpropogation, the network 
modifies the weights to improve the network's output accuracy. You'll be applying all of this shortly.

In this next quiz, you'll try to build a linear neuron that generates an output by applying a simplified version of 
Equation (1). ```Linear``` should take an list of inbound nodes of length n, a list of weights of length n, and a bias.

###### Instructions

1. Open nn.py below. Read through the neural network to see the expected output of ```Linear```.
2. Open miniflow.py below. Modify ```Linear```, which is a subclass of ```Node```, to generate an output with Equation (1).

(Hint: you could use ```numpy``` to solve this quiz if you'd like, but it's possible to solve this with vanilla Python.)

### 8. Linear transform

###### Solution to Linear Node

Here's my solution to the last quiz:

````python
class Linear(Node):
    def __init__(self, inputs, weights, bias):
        Node.__init__(self, [inputs, weights, bias])

    def forward(self):
        """
        Set self.value to the value of the linear function output.

        Your code goes here!
        """
        inputs = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
        weights = self.inbound_nodes[1].value
        bias = self.inbound_nodes[2].value
        self.value = bias
        for x, w in zip(inputs, weights):
            self.value += x * w
````

In the solution, I set ```self.value``` to the bias and then loop through the inputs and weights, adding each weighted 
input to ```self.value```. Notice calling ```.value``` on ```self.inbound_nodes[0]``` or ```self.inbound_nodes[1]``` 
gives us a list.

[Linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) nicely reflects the idea of transforming values 
between layers in a graph. In fact, the concept of a [transform](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/linear-transformations/v/vector-transformations) 
does exactly what a layer should do - it converts inputs to outputs in many dimensions.

Let's go back to our equation for the output.

_o_ = &#8721;<sub>i</sub> _x_<sub>_i_</sub> &#8901; _&#969;_<sub>_i_</sub> + _b_

Equation (1)

For the rest of this section we'll denote _x_ as _X_ and _w_ as _W_ since they are now matrices, and bb is now a vector 
instead of a scalar.

Consider a ```Linear``` node with 1 input and k outputs (mapping 1 input to k outputs). In this context an input/output 
is synonymous with a feature.

In this case _X_ is a 1 by 1 matrix.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581f9571_newx/newx.png)

_W_ becomes a 1 by k matrix (looks like a row).

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581f9571_neww/neww.png)

The result of the matrix multiplication of _X_ and _W_ is a 1 by k matrix. Since bb is also a 1 by k row matrix (1 bias 
per output), _b_ is added to the output of the _X_ and _W_ matrix multiplication.

What if we are mapping n inputs to k outputs?

Then _X_  is now a 1 by n matrix and _W_ is a n by k matrix. The result of the matrix multiplication is still a 1 by k 
matrix so the use of the biases remain the same.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581f9570_newx-1n/newx-1n.png)

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581a94e5_b-1byk/b-1byk.png)

Let's take a look at an example of n input features. Consider an 28px by 28px greyscale image, as is in the case of 
images in the MNIST dataset. We can reshape (flatten) the image such that it's a 1 by 784 matrix, where n = 784. Each 
pixel is an input/feature. Here's an animated example emphasizing a pixel is a feature.

[![zoom-in](http://img.youtube.com/vi/qE5YYXtPq9U/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qE5YYXtPq9U "zoom-in")

In practice, it's common to feed in multiple data examples in each forward pass rather than just 1. The reasoning for 
this is the examples can be processed in parallel, resulting in big performance gains. The number of examples is called 
the batch size. Common numbers for the batch size are 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. Generally, it's the most we can comfortably 
fit in memory.

What does this mean for _X_, _W_ and _b_?

_X_ becomes a m by n matrix (where m is the batch size, by the number of input features, n) and _W_ and _b_ remain the 
same. The result of the matrix multiplication is now m by k (batch size by number of outputs), so the addition of _b_ is 
broadcast over each row.

![alt txet](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5820bdff_x-mn/x-mn.png)

In the context of MNIST each row of _X_ is an image reshaped/flattened from 28 by 28 to 1 by 784.
Equation (1) turns into:

![alt txet](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5820f6bc_z/z.png)

Equation (2) can also be viewed as _Z = XW + B_ where _B_ is the biases vector, _b_, stacked m times. Due to 
broadcasting it's abbreviated to _Z = XW + b_.

I want you to rebuild ```Linear``` to handle matrices and vectors using the venerable Python math package ```numpy``` to 
make your life easier. ```numpy``` is often abbreviated as ```np```, so we'll refer to it as ```np``` when referring to 
code.

I used ```np.array``` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)) to create the matrices and vectors. You'll want to use ```np.dot```, which functions 
as matrix multiplication for 2D arrays ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)), to multiply the input and weights matrices from Equation (2). 
It's also worth noting that numpy actually overloads the ```__add__``` operator so you can use it directly with np.array 
```(eg. np.array() + np.array())```.

### 9. Sigmoid function

Here's my solution to the last quiz:

```
class Linear(Node):
    def __init__(self, X, W, b):
        # Notice the ordering of the inputs passed to the
        # Node constructor.
        Node.__init__(self, [X, W, b])

    def forward(self):
        X = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
        W = self.inbound_nodes[1].value
        b = self.inbound_nodes[2].value
        self.value = np.dot(X, W) + b
```

Nothing fancy in my solution. I pulled the value of the ```X```, ```W``` and ```b``` from their respective inputs. I 
used ```np.dot``` to handle the matrix multiplication.

###### Sigmoid Function

Neural networks take advantage of alternating transforms and activation functions to better categorize outputs. The 
sigmoid function is among the most common activation functions.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/58102c91_19/19.png)

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/581142a9_pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-17-pm/pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-17-pm.png)

Linear transforms are great for simply shifting values, but neural networks often require a more nuanced transform. For 
instance, one of the original designs for an artificial neuron, [the perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), 
exhibits binary output behavior. Perceptrons compare a weighted input to a threshold. When the weighted input exceeds 
the threshold, the perceptron is **activated** and outputs ```1```, otherwise it outputs ```0```.

You could model a perceptron's behavior as a step function:

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/581142e2_save-2/save-2.png)

Activation, the idea of binary output behavior, generally makes sense for classification problems. For example, if you 
ask the network to hypothesize if a handwritten image is a '9', you're effectively asking for a binary output - yes, 
this is a '9', or no, this is not a '9'. A step function is the starkest form of a binary output, which is great, but 
step functions are not continuous and not differentiable, which is very bad. Differentiation is what makes gradient 
descent possible.

The sigmoid function, Equation (3) above, replaces thresholding with a beautiful S-shaped curve (also shown above) that 
mimics the activation behavior of a perceptron while being differentiable. As a bonus, the sigmoid function has a very 
simple derivative that that can be calculated from the sigmoid function itself, as shown in Equation (4) below.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/58102459_21/21.png)

Notice that the sigmoid function only has one parameter. Remember that sigmoid is an activation function (non-linearity)
, meaning it takes a single input and performs a mathematical operation on it.

Conceptually, the sigmoid function makes decisions. When given weighted features from some data, it indicates whether or 
not the features contribute to a classification. In that way, a sigmoid activation works well following a linear 
transformation. As it stands right now with random weights and bias, the sigmoid node's output is also random. The 
process of learning through backpropagation and gradient descent, which you will implement soon, modifies the weights 
and bias such that activation of the sigmoid node begins to match expected outputs.

Now that I've given you the equation for the sigmoid function, I want you to add it to the ```MiniFlow library```. To do 
so, you'll want to use ```np.exp``` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html)) 
to make your life much easier.

You'll be using ```Sigmoid``` in conjunction with ```Linear```. Here's how it should look:

### 10. Cost

Here's how I implemented the sigmoid function.

```
class Sigmoid(Node):
    def __init__(self, node):
        Node.__init__(self, [node])

    def _sigmoid(self, x):
        """
        This method is separate from `forward` because it
        will be used with `backward` as well.

        `x`: A numpy array-like object.
        """
        return 1. / (1. + np.exp(-x)) # the `.` ensures that `1` is a float

    def forward(self):
        input_value = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
        self.value = self._sigmoid(input_value)
```

It may have seemed strange that ```_sigmoid``` was a separate method. As seen in the derivative of the sigmoid function, 
Equation (4), the sigmoid function is actually a part of its own derivative. Keeping ```_sigmoid``` separate means you 
won't have to implement it twice for forward and backward propagations.

This is exciting! At this point, you have used weights and biases to compute outputs. And you've used an activation 
function to categorize the output. As you may recall, neural networks improve the accuracy of their outputs by modifying 
weights and biases in response to training against labeled datasets.

There are many techniques for defining the **accuracy** of a neural network, all of which center on the network's 
ability to produce values that come as close as possible to known correct values. People use different names for this 
accuracy measurement, often terming it **loss** or **cost**. I'll use the term cost most often.

For this lab, you will calculate the cost using the mean squared error (MSE). It looks like so:

C(w,b)= (1/m) âˆ‘<sub>x</sub> âˆ£âˆ£y(x)âˆ’aâˆ£âˆ£<sup>2</sup>

Equation (5)

Here _w_ denotes the collection of all weights in the network, _b_ all the biases, _m_ is the total number of training 
examples, and aa is the approximation of _y(x)_ by the network. Note that both aa and _y(x)_ are vectors of the same 
length.

The collection of weights is all the weight matrices flattened into vectors and concatenated to one big vector. The same 
goes for the collection of biases except they're already vectors so there's no need to flatten them prior to the 
concatenation.

Here's an example of creating _w_ in code:

```
# 2 by 2 matrices
w1  = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
w2  = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# flatten
w1_flat = np.reshape(w1, -1)
w2_flat = np.reshape(w2, -1)

w = np.concatenate((w1_flat, w2_flat))
# array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
```

It's a nice way to abstract all the weights and biases used in the neural network and makes some things easier to write 
as we'll see soon in the upcoming gradient descent sections.

**NOTE**: It's not required you do this in your code! It's just easier to do this talk about the weights and biases as a 
collective than consider them invidually.

The cost, C, depends on the difference between the correct output, y(x), and the network's output, a. It's easy to see 
that no difference between y(x) and a (for all values of x) leads to a cost of 0.

This is the ideal situation, and in fact the learning process revolves around minimizing the cost as much as possible.

I want you to calculate the cost now.

You implemented this network in the forward direction in the last quiz.

As it stands right now, it outputs gibberish. The activation of the sigmoid node means nothing because the network has 
no labeled output against which to compare. Furthermore, the weights and bias cannot change and learning cannot happen 
without a cost.

###### Instructions

For this quiz, you will run the forward pass against the network in nn.py. I want you to finish implementing the ```MSE``` 
method so that it calculates the cost from the equation above.

I recommend using the ```np.square``` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.square.html)) 
method to make your life easier.

1. Check out nn.py to see how ```MSE``` will calculate the cost.
2. Open miniflow.py. Finish building ```MSE```.
3. Test your network! See if the cost makes sense given the inputs by playing with nn.py.

### 11. Gradient descent 1

Here's how I implemented ```MSE```:

```
class MSE(Node):
    def __init__(self, y, a):
        """
        The mean squared error cost function.
        Should be used as the last node for a network.
        """
        # Call the base class' constructor.
        Node.__init__(self, [y, a])

    def forward(self):
        """
        Calculates the mean squared error.
        """
        # NOTE: We reshape these to avoid possible matrix/vector broadcast
        # errors.
        #
        # For example, if we subtract an array of shape (3,) from an array of shape
        # (3,1) we get an array of shape(3,3) as the result when we want
        # an array of shape (3,1) instead.
        #
        # Making both arrays (3,1) insures the result is (3,1) and does
        # an elementwise subtraction as expected.
        y = self.inbound_nodes[0].value.reshape(-1, 1)
        a = self.inbound_nodes[1].value.reshape(-1, 1)
        m = self.inbound_nodes[0].value.shape[0]

        diff = y - a
        self.value = np.mean(diff**2)
```

The math behind ```MSE``` reflects Equation (5), where yy is target output and aa is output computed by the neural network. We 
then square the difference ```diff^2```, alternatively, this could be ```np.square(diff)```. Lastly we need to sum the squared 
differences and divide by the total number of examples mm (note that mm can be taken from the shape of either yy or aa, 
as they have the same shape). This can be achieved in with ```np.mean``` or ```(1 /m) * np.sum(diff^2)```.

Note the order of ```y``` and ```a``` doesn't actually matter, we could switch them around (```a - y```) and get the 
same value.

###### Backpropagation

Great! We've successfully calculated a full forward pass and found the cost. Next we need to start a backwards pass, 
which starts with backpropagation. Backpropagation is the process by which the network runs error values backwards.

During this process, the network calculates the way in which the weights need to change (also called the gradient) to 
reduce the overall error of the network. Changing the weights usually occurs through a technique called gradient descent.

Making sense of the purpose of backpropagation comes more easily after you work through the intended outcome. I'll come 
back to backpropagation in a bit, but first, I want to dive deeper into gradient descent.

###### Gradient Descent

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/58114bfa_pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-24-pm/pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-24-pm.png)

Imagine a point on a surface in three dimensional space. In real-life, a ball sitting on the slope of a valley makes a 
nice analogy. In this case, the height of the point represents the difference between the current output of the network 
and the correct output given the current parameter values (hence why you need data with known outputs). Each dimension 
of the plane represents another parameter to the network. A network with m parameters would be a hypersurface of m 
dimensions.

(Imagining more than three dimensions [is tricky](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/25983/intuitive-crutches-for-higher-dimensional-thinking)
. The good news is that the ball and valley example describes the behavior of gradient descent well, the only difference 
between three dimensional and n dimensional situations being the number of parameters in the calculations.)

In the ideal situation, the ball rests at the bottom of the valley, indicating the minimum difference between the output 
of the network and the known correct output.

The learning process starts with random weights and biases. In the ball analogy, the ball starts at a random point near 
the valley.

Gradient descent works by first calculating the slope of the plane at the current point, which includes calculating the 
partial derivatives of the loss with respect to all of the weights. This set of partial derivatives is called the 
**gradient**. Then it uses the gradient to modify the weights such that the next forward pass through the network moves 
the output lower in the hypersurface. Physically, this would be the same as measuring the slope of the valley at the 
location of the ball, and then moving the ball a small amount in the direction of the slope. Over time, it's possible to 
find the bottom of the valley with many small movements.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/58114c5e_pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-24-pm/pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-24-pm.png)

While gradient descent works remarkably well, the technique isn't **guaranteed** to find the absolute minimum difference 
between the network's output and the known output. Why?

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swoldetsadick/sdce/master/Lessons/images/07_10.PNG)

### 12. Gradient descent 2

###### Journey to the Bottom of the Valley

We know we'd like to move the ball to the bottom of the valley, but how do we accomplish this?

Intuitively, we want to push the ball downhill. And that makes sense, but when we're talking about our cost function, 
how do we know which way is downhill?

Luckily, the gradient provides this exact information.

Technically, the gradient actually points uphill, in the direction of **steepest ascent**. But if we put a ```-``` sign 
at the front this value, we get the direction of **steepest descent**, which is what we want.

You'll learn more about the gradient in a moment, but, for now, just think of it as a vector of numbers. Each number 
represents the amount by which we should adjust a corresponding weight or bias in the neural network. Adjusting all of 
the weights and biases by the gradient values reduces the cost (or error) of the network.

Got all that?

Great! Now we know where to push the ball. The next thing to consider is how much force should be applied to the push. 
This is known as the learning rate, which is an apt name since this value determines how quickly or slowly the neural 
network learns.

You might be tempted to set a really big learning rate, so the network learns really fast, right?

Be careful! If the value is too large you could overshoot the target and eventually diverge. Yikes!

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/5840d0aa_gradient-descent-convergence/gradient-descent-convergence.gif)

**Convergence: This is really good**

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/5840d077_gradient-descent-divergence/gradient-descent-divergence.gif)

**Divergence: Not good this is what happens when learning rate is too big**

So what is a good learning rate, then?

This is more of a guessing game than anything else but empirically values in the range 0.1 to 0.0001 work well. The 
range 0.001 to 0.0001 is popular, as 0.1 and 0.01 are sometimes too large.

Here's the formula for gradient descent (pseudocode):

```
x = x - learning_rate * gradient_of_x
```

```x``` is a parameter used by the neural network (i.e. a single weight or bias).

We multiply ```gradient_of_x``` (the uphill direction) by ```learning_rate``` (the force of the push) and then subtract 
that from ```x``` to make the push go downhill.

Awesome! Time to apply all this in a quiz.

###### Setup

For this quiz you'll complete TODOs in both the ```f.py``` and ```gd.py``` files.

Tasks:

* Set the ```learning_rate``` in ```f.py```.
* Complete the gradient descent implementation in ```gradient_descent_update``` function in ```gd.py```.

Notes:

* Setting the ```learning_rate``` to 0.1 should result in ```x``` -> 0 and ```f(x)``` -> 5 if you've implemented gradient descent correctly.
* Play around with different values for the learning rate. Try very small values, values close to 1, above 1, etc. What happens?

###### It's working, but...

You've now implemented a basic neural network, with a forward pass, backpropagation, and the ability to train the 
network to output an updated model.

If backpropagation still feels like a mystery to you, let's walk through a brief example to hopefully give you more 
intuition on what's occurring at a low level in the network. If you already feel comfortable with backpropagation, feel 
free to skip this section.

We'll focus on a simpler backwards pass that performs similarly to our ```Linear``` class from before.

###### Defining our variables

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swoldetsadick/sdce/master/Lessons/images/07_13.PNG)

###### Forward and backward pass

We'll ignore the bias in the above graph for now.

Note that the forward pass here takes our input, _X_, and takes the dot product against the weights, _W_, to produce the 
value of the ```Linear``` layer, _l<sub>1</sub>_. We're actually going to skip over what happens from _l<sub>1</sub>_ 
onward, so we'll just show this forward pass as getting fed there each time.

â€‹
Going backwards for backpropagation, we'll get the gradient g<sub>i</sub> in place of l<sub>1</sub> from before:

It may be useful to note again here that the weights are tied to each feature from an input, while the gradients are 
tied to each input separately (i.e., the first weight ties to the first feature for both of our data points, while the 
first gradient ties to the first data point as a whole).

You just built a mini version of TensorFlow!

Congratulations on making it to the end of this lab! Building a neural network from scratch is no small task. You should 
be proud!

MiniFlow has the makings of becoming a powerful deep learning tool. It is entirely possible to classify something like 
the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database with MiniFlow.

I'll leave it as an exercise for you to finish MiniFlow from here.

In the next lessons, you'll work with TensorFlow and then Keras, a high level framework on top of TensorFlow. Now that 
you've built a neural network from scratch, you should be in great shape!
