### 2. Introduction

In this lab, youâ€™ll build a library called MiniFlow which will be your own version of [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/)! (link for [China](http://tensorfly.cn/))

TensorFlow is one of the most popular open source neural network libraries, built by the team at Google Brain over just 
the last few years.

Following this lab, you'll spend the remainder of this module actually working with open-source deep learning libraries 
like [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). So why bother building MiniFlow? Good question, glad you asked!

The goal of this lab is to demystify two concepts at the heart of neural networks - backpropagation and differentiable 
graphs.

Backpropagation is the process by which neural networks update the weights of the network over time. (You may have seen 
it in [this video](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/83a4e710-a69e-4ce9-9af9-939307c0711b/concepts/4cc13714-37d7-4705-a714-314ede5290b5#) earlier.)

Differentiable graphs are graphs where the nodes are [differentiable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function). 
They are also useful as visual aids for understanding and calculating complicated derivatives. This is the fundamental 
abstraction of TensorFlow - it's a framework for creating differentiable graphs.

With graphs and backpropagation, you will be able to create your own nodes and properly compute the derivatives. Even 
more importantly, you will be able to think and reason in terms of these graphs.

Now, let's take the first peek under the hood...

### 3. Graphs

###### What is a Neural Network?

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/58375218_example-neural-network/example-neural-network.png)

A neural network is a graph of mathematical functions such as [linear combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination) 
and activation functions. The graph consists of **nodes**, and **edges**.

Nodes in each layer (except for nodes in the input layer) perform mathematical functions using inputs from nodes in the 
previous layers. For example, a node could represent f(x, y) = x + y, where x and y are input values from 
nodes in the previous layer.

Similarly, each node creates an output value which may be passed to nodes in the next layer. The output value from the 
output layer does not get passed to a future layer (because it is the final layer).

Layers between the input layer and the output layer are called **hidden layers**.

The edges in the graph describe the connections between the nodes, along which the values flow from one layer to the 
next. These edges can also apply operations to the values that flow along them, such as multiplying by weights and 
adding biases. MiniFlow won't use a separate class for edges - instead, its nodes will perform both their own 
calculations and those of their input edges. This will be more clear as you go through these lessons.

###### Forward Propagation

By propagating values from the first layer (the input layer) through all the mathematical functions represented by each 
node, the network outputs a value. This process is called a forward pass.

Here's an example of a simple **forward pass**.

[![forward pass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swoldetsadick/sdce/master/Lessons/images/07_01.PNG)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/carnd/videos/input-to-output-2.mp4 "forward pass")

Notice that the output layer performs a mathematical function, addition, on its inputs. There is no hidden layer.

###### Graphs

The nodes and edges create a graph structure. Though the example above is fairly simple, it isn't hard to imagine that 
increasingly complex graphs can calculate . . . well . . . almost anything.

There are generally two steps to create neural networks:

1. Define the graph of nodes and edges.
2. Propagate values through the graph.

```MiniFlow``` works the same way. You'll define the nodes and edges of your network with one method and then propagate values 
through the graph with another method. 

```MiniFlow``` comes with some starter code to help you out. We'll take a look on the 
next page, but first, let's test your intuition.

### 4. MiniFlow architecture

Let's consider how to implement this graph structure in ```MiniFlow```. We'll use a Python class to represent a generic 
node.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self):
        # Properties will go here!
````

We know that each node might receive input from multiple other nodes. We also know that each node creates a single 
output, which will likely be passed to other nodes. Let's add two lists: one to store references to the inbound nodes, 
and the other to store references to the outbound nodes.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Node(s) to which this Node passes values
        self.outbound_nodes = []
        # For each inbound_node, add the current Node as an outbound_node.
        for n in self.inbound_nodes:
            n.outbound_nodes.append(self)
````

Each node will eventually calculate a value that represents its output. Let's initialize the ```value``` to ```None``` 
to indicate that it exists but hasn't been set yet.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Node(s) to which this Node passes values
        self.outbound_nodes = []
        # For each inbound_node, add the current Node as an outbound_node.
        for n in self.inbound_nodes:
            n.outbound_nodes.append(self)
        # A calculated value
        self.value = None
````

Each node will need to be able to pass values forward and perform backpropagation (more on that later). For now, let's 
add a placeholder method for forward propagation. We'll deal with backpropagation later on.

````python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Node(s) to which this Node passes values
        self.outbound_nodes = []
        # For each inbound_node, add the current Node as an outbound_node.
        for n in self.inbound_nodes:
            n.outbound_nodes.append(self)
        # A calculated value
        self.value = None

    def forward(self):
        """
        Forward propagation.

        Compute the output value based on `inbound_nodes` and
        store the result in self.value.
        """
        raise NotImplemented
````

###### Nodes that Calculate

While ```Node``` defines the base set of properties that every node holds, only specialized [subclasses]() of ```Node``` 
will end up in the graph. As part of this lab, you'll build the subclasses of ```Node``` that can perform calculations 
and hold values. For example, consider the ```Input``` subclass of ```Node```.

````python
class Input(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        # An Input node has no inbound nodes,
        # so no need to pass anything to the Node instantiator.
        Node.__init__(self)

    # NOTE: Input node is the only node where the value
    # may be passed as an argument to forward().
    #
    # All other node implementations should get the value
    # of the previous node from self.inbound_nodes
    #
    # Example:
    # val0 = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
    def forward(self, value=None):
        # Overwrite the value if one is passed in.
        if value is not None:
            self.value = value
````

Unlike the other subclasses of ```Node```, the ```Input``` subclass does not actually calculate anything. The ```Input``` 
subclass just holds a ```value```, such as a data feature or a model parameter (weight/bias).

You can set ```value``` either explicitly or with the ```forward()``` method. This value is then fed through the rest of 
the neural network.

###### The Add Subclass

```Add```, which is another subclass of ```Node```, actually can perform a calculation (addition).

````python
class Add(Node):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        Node.__init__(self, [x, y])

    def forward(self):
        """
        You'll be writing code here in the next quiz!
        """
````

Notice the difference in the ```__init__``` method, ```Add.__init__(self, [x, y])```. Unlike the ```Input``` class, 
which has no inbound nodes, the ```Add``` class takes 2 inbound nodes, ```x``` and ```y```, and adds the values of those 
nodes.

### 5. Forward propagation

```MiniFlow``` has two methods to help you define and then run values through your graphs: ```topological_sort()``` and 
```forward_pass()```.

In order to define your network, you'll need to define the order of operations for your nodes. Given that the input to 
some node depends on the outputs of others, you need to flatten the graph in such a way where all the input dependencies 
for each node are resolved before trying to run its calculation. This is a technique called a [topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swoldetsadick/sdce/master/Lessons/images/07_04.jpeg)

The ```topological_sort()``` function implements topological sorting using [Kahn's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn.27s_algorithm). The details of this method are 
not important, the result is; ```topological_sort()``` returns a sorted list of nodes in which all of the calculations 
can run in series. ```topological_sort()``` takes in a ```feed_dict```, which is how we initially set a value for an 
```Input``` node. The ```feed_dict``` is represented by the Python dictionary data structure. Here's an example use 
case:

````python
# Define 2 `Input` nodes.
x, y = Input(), Input()

# Define an `Add` node, the two above `Input` nodes being the input.
add = Add(x, y)

# The value of `x` and `y` will be set to 10 and 20 respectively.
feed_dict = {x: 10, y: 20}

# Sort the nodes with topological sort.
sorted_nodes = topological_sort(feed_dict=feed_dict)
````

(You can find the source code for ```topological_sort()``` in miniflow.py in the programming quiz below.)

The other method at your disposal is ```forward_pass()```, which actually runs the network and outputs a value.

````python
def forward_pass(output_node, sorted_nodes):
    """
    Performs a forward pass through a list of sorted nodes.

    Arguments:

        `output_node`: The output node of the graph (no outgoing edges).
        `sorted_nodes`: a topologically sorted list of nodes.

    Returns the output node's value
    """

    for n in sorted_nodes:
        n.forward()

    return output_node.value
````

###### Setup

Review ```nn.py``` and ```miniflow.py```.

The neural network architecture is already there for you in nn.py. It's your job to finish ```MiniFlow``` to make it work.

For this quiz, I want you to:

1. Open ```nn.py``` below. **You don't need to change anything**. I just want you to see how ```MiniFlow``` works.
2. Open ```miniflow.py```. **Finish the** ```forward``` **method on the** ```Add``` **class. All that's required to pass 
this quiz is a correct implementation of** ```forward```**.**
3. Test your network by hitting "Test Run!" When the output looks right, hit "Submit!"

(You'll find the solution on the next page.)

### 6. Forward propagation solution

Here's my solution (I'm just showing ```forward``` method of the ```Add``` class):

```
def forward(self):
    x_value = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
    y_value = self.inbound_nodes[1].value
    self.value = x_value + y_value
```

While this looks simple, I want to show you why I used ```x_value``` and ```y_value``` from the ```inbound_nodes``` 
array. Let's take a look at the start with ```Node```'s constructor:

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, inbound_nodes=[]):
        # Node(s) from which this Node receives values.
        self.inbound_nodes = inbound_nodes
        # Removed everything else for brevity.
```

```inbound_nodes``` are set when the ```Node``` is instantiated.

Of course, you weren't using ```Node``` directly, rather you used ```Add```, which is a subclass of ```Node```. 
```Add```'s constructor is responsible for passing the ```inbound_nodes``` to ```Node```, which happens here:

```
class Add(Node):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
         Node.__init__(self, [x, y]) # calls Node's constructor
    ...
```

Lastly, there's the question of why ```node.value``` holds the value of the inputs. For each node of the ```Input()``` 
class, the nodes are set directly when you run ```topological_sort```:

```
def topological_sort(feed_dict):
    ...
    if isinstance(n, Input):
        n.value = feed_dict[n]
    ...
```

For other classes, the value of node.value is set in the forward pass:

```
def forward_pass(output_node, sorted_nodes):
    ...
    for n in sorted_nodes:
        n.forward()
    ...
```

And that's it for addition!

Keep going to make ```MiniFlow``` more capable.

###### Bonus Challenges!

These are **ungraded** challenges as they are more of a test of your Python skills than neural network skills.

2. Can you make a ```Mul``` class that multiplies _n_ inputs?

### 7. Learning and Loss

Like ```MiniFlow``` in its current state, neural networks take inputs and produce outputs. But unlike ```MiniFlow``` in its current 
state, neural networks can improve the accuracy of their outputs over time (it's hard to imagine improving the accuracy 
of ```Add``` over time!). To explore why accuracy matters, I want you to first implement a trickier (and more useful!) node

Think back to the Neural Networks lesson with Luis and Matt. A simple artificial neuron depends on three components:

* inputs, _x_ (vector)
* weights, _&#969;_ (vector)
* bias, _b_ (scalar)

The output, _o_, is just the weighted sum of the inputs plus the bias:

_o_ = &#8721;<sub>i</sub> _x_<sub>_i_</sub> &#8901; _&#969;_<sub>_i_</sub> + _b_

Equation (1)

Remember, by varying the weights, you can vary the amount of influence any given input has on the output. The learning 
aspect of neural networks takes place during a process known as backpropagation. In backpropogation, the network 
modifies the weights to improve the network's output accuracy. You'll be applying all of this shortly.

In this next quiz, you'll try to build a linear neuron that generates an output by applying a simplified version of 
Equation (1). ```Linear``` should take an list of inbound nodes of length n, a list of weights of length n, and a bias.

###### Instructions

1. Open nn.py below. Read through the neural network to see the expected output of ```Linear```.
2. Open miniflow.py below. Modify ```Linear```, which is a subclass of ```Node```, to generate an output with Equation (1).

(Hint: you could use ```numpy``` to solve this quiz if you'd like, but it's possible to solve this with vanilla Python.)

### 8. Linear transform

###### Solution to Linear Node

Here's my solution to the last quiz:

````python
class Linear(Node):
    def __init__(self, inputs, weights, bias):
        Node.__init__(self, [inputs, weights, bias])

    def forward(self):
        """
        Set self.value to the value of the linear function output.

        Your code goes here!
        """
        inputs = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
        weights = self.inbound_nodes[1].value
        bias = self.inbound_nodes[2].value
        self.value = bias
        for x, w in zip(inputs, weights):
            self.value += x * w
````

In the solution, I set ```self.value``` to the bias and then loop through the inputs and weights, adding each weighted 
input to ```self.value```. Notice calling ```.value``` on ```self.inbound_nodes[0]``` or ```self.inbound_nodes[1]``` 
gives us a list.

[Linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) nicely reflects the idea of transforming values 
between layers in a graph. In fact, the concept of a [transform](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/linear-transformations/v/vector-transformations) 
does exactly what a layer should do - it converts inputs to outputs in many dimensions.

Let's go back to our equation for the output.

_o_ = &#8721;<sub>i</sub> _x_<sub>_i_</sub> &#8901; _&#969;_<sub>_i_</sub> + _b_

Equation (1)

For the rest of this section we'll denote _x_ as _X_ and _w_ as _W_ since they are now matrices, and bb is now a vector 
instead of a scalar.

Consider a ```Linear``` node with 1 input and k outputs (mapping 1 input to k outputs). In this context an input/output 
is synonymous with a feature.

In this case _X_ is a 1 by 1 matrix.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581f9571_newx/newx.png)

_W_ becomes a 1 by k matrix (looks like a row).

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581f9571_neww/neww.png)

The result of the matrix multiplication of _X_ and _W_ is a 1 by k matrix. Since bb is also a 1 by k row matrix (1 bias 
per output), _b_ is added to the output of the _X_ and _W_ matrix multiplication.

What if we are mapping n inputs to k outputs?

Then _X_  is now a 1 by n matrix and _W_ is a n by k matrix. The result of the matrix multiplication is still a 1 by k 
matrix so the use of the biases remain the same.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581f9570_newx-1n/newx-1n.png)

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581a94e5_b-1byk/b-1byk.png)

Let's take a look at an example of n input features. Consider an 28px by 28px greyscale image, as is in the case of 
images in the MNIST dataset. We can reshape (flatten) the image such that it's a 1 by 784 matrix, where n = 784. Each 
pixel is an input/feature. Here's an animated example emphasizing a pixel is a feature.

[![zoom-in](http://img.youtube.com/vi/qE5YYXtPq9U/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qE5YYXtPq9U "zoom-in")

In practice, it's common to feed in multiple data examples in each forward pass rather than just 1. The reasoning for 
this is the examples can be processed in parallel, resulting in big performance gains. The number of examples is called 
the batch size. Common numbers for the batch size are 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. Generally, it's the most we can comfortably 
fit in memory.

What does this mean for _X_, _W_ and _b_?

_X_ becomes a m by n matrix (where m is the batch size, by the number of input features, n) and _W_ and _b_ remain the 
same. The result of the matrix multiplication is now m by k (batch size by number of outputs), so the addition of _b_ is 
broadcast over each row.

![alt txet](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5820bdff_x-mn/x-mn.png)

In the context of MNIST each row of _X_ is an image reshaped/flattened from 28 by 28 to 1 by 784.
Equation (1) turns into:

![alt txet](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5820f6bc_z/z.png)

Equation (2) can also be viewed as _Z = XW + B_ where _B_ is the biases vector, _b_, stacked m times. Due to 
broadcasting it's abbreviated to _Z = XW + b_.

I want you to rebuild ```Linear``` to handle matrices and vectors using the venerable Python math package ```numpy``` to 
make your life easier. ```numpy``` is often abbreviated as ```np```, so we'll refer to it as ```np``` when referring to 
code.

I used ```np.array``` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)) to create the matrices and vectors. You'll want to use ```np.dot```, which functions 
as matrix multiplication for 2D arrays ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)), to multiply the input and weights matrices from Equation (2). 
It's also worth noting that numpy actually overloads the ```__add__``` operator so you can use it directly with np.array 
```(eg. np.array() + np.array())```.

### 9. Sigmoid function

Here's my solution to the last quiz:

```
class Linear(Node):
    def __init__(self, X, W, b):
        # Notice the ordering of the inputs passed to the
        # Node constructor.
        Node.__init__(self, [X, W, b])

    def forward(self):
        X = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
        W = self.inbound_nodes[1].value
        b = self.inbound_nodes[2].value
        self.value = np.dot(X, W) + b
```

Nothing fancy in my solution. I pulled the value of the ```X```, ```W``` and ```b``` from their respective inputs. I 
used ```np.dot``` to handle the matrix multiplication.

###### Sigmoid Function

Neural networks take advantage of alternating transforms and activation functions to better categorize outputs. The 
sigmoid function is among the most common activation functions.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/58102c91_19/19.png)

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/581142a9_pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-17-pm/pasted-image-at-2016-10-25-01-17-pm.png)

Linear transforms are great for simply shifting values, but neural networks often require a more nuanced transform. For 
instance, one of the original designs for an artificial neuron, [the perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), 
exhibits binary output behavior. Perceptrons compare a weighted input to a threshold. When the weighted input exceeds 
the threshold, the perceptron is **activated** and outputs ```1```, otherwise it outputs ```0```.

You could model a perceptron's behavior as a step function:

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/581142e2_save-2/save-2.png)

Activation, the idea of binary output behavior, generally makes sense for classification problems. For example, if you 
ask the network to hypothesize if a handwritten image is a '9', you're effectively asking for a binary output - yes, 
this is a '9', or no, this is not a '9'. A step function is the starkest form of a binary output, which is great, but 
step functions are not continuous and not differentiable, which is very bad. Differentiation is what makes gradient 
descent possible.

The sigmoid function, Equation (3) above, replaces thresholding with a beautiful S-shaped curve (also shown above) that 
mimics the activation behavior of a perceptron while being differentiable. As a bonus, the sigmoid function has a very 
simple derivative that that can be calculated from the sigmoid function itself, as shown in Equation (4) below.

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/58102459_21/21.png)

Notice that the sigmoid function only has one parameter. Remember that sigmoid is an activation function (non-linearity)
, meaning it takes a single input and performs a mathematical operation on it.

Conceptually, the sigmoid function makes decisions. When given weighted features from some data, it indicates whether or 
not the features contribute to a classification. In that way, a sigmoid activation works well following a linear 
transformation. As it stands right now with random weights and bias, the sigmoid node's output is also random. The 
process of learning through backpropagation and gradient descent, which you will implement soon, modifies the weights 
and bias such that activation of the sigmoid node begins to match expected outputs.

Now that I've given you the equation for the sigmoid function, I want you to add it to the ```MiniFlow library```. To do 
so, you'll want to use ```np.exp``` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html)) 
to make your life much easier.

You'll be using ```Sigmoid``` in conjunction with ```Linear```. Here's how it should look:

### 10. Cost

Here's how I implemented the sigmoid function.

```
class Sigmoid(Node):
    def __init__(self, node):
        Node.__init__(self, [node])

    def _sigmoid(self, x):
        """
        This method is separate from `forward` because it
        will be used with `backward` as well.

        `x`: A numpy array-like object.
        """
        return 1. / (1. + np.exp(-x)) # the `.` ensures that `1` is a float

    def forward(self):
        input_value = self.inbound_nodes[0].value
        self.value = self._sigmoid(input_value)
```

It may have seemed strange that ```_sigmoid``` was a separate method. As seen in the derivative of the sigmoid function, 
Equation (4), the sigmoid function is actually a part of its own derivative. Keeping ```_sigmoid``` separate means you 
won't have to implement it twice for forward and backward propagations.

This is exciting! At this point, you have used weights and biases to compute outputs. And you've used an activation 
function to categorize the output. As you may recall, neural networks improve the accuracy of their outputs by modifying 
weights and biases in response to training against labeled datasets.

There are many techniques for defining the **accuracy** of a neural network, all of which center on the network's 
ability to produce values that come as close as possible to known correct values. People use different names for this 
accuracy measurement, often terming it **loss** or **cost**. I'll use the term cost most often.

For this lab, you will calculate the cost using the mean squared error (MSE). It looks like so:



Here _w_ denotes the collection of all weights in the network, _b_ all the biases, _m_ is the total number of training 
examples, and aa is the approximation of _y(x)_ by the network. Note that both aa and _y(x)_ are vectors of the same 
length.

The collection of weights is all the weight matrices flattened into vectors and concatenated to one big vector. The same 
goes for the collection of biases except they're already vectors so there's no need to flatten them prior to the 
concatenation.

Here's an example of creating _w_ in code:

```
# 2 by 2 matrices
w1  = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
w2  = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# flatten
w1_flat = np.reshape(w1, -1)
w2_flat = np.reshape(w2, -1)

w = np.concatenate((w1_flat, w2_flat))
# array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
```

It's a nice way to abstract all the weights and biases used in the neural network and makes some things easier to write 
as we'll see soon in the upcoming gradient descent sections.

**NOTE**: It's not required you do this in your code! It's just easier to do this talk about the weights and biases as a 
collective than consider them invidually.

The cost, C, depends on the difference between the correct output, y(x), and the network's output, a. It's easy to see 
that no difference between y(x) and a (for all values of x) leads to a cost of 0.

This is the ideal situation, and in fact the learning process revolves around minimizing the cost as much as possible.

I want you to calculate the cost now.

You implemented this network in the forward direction in the last quiz.

As it stands right now, it outputs gibberish. The activation of the sigmoid node means nothing because the network has 
no labeled output against which to compare. Furthermore, the weights and bias cannot change and learning cannot happen 
without a cost.

###### Instructions

For this quiz, you will run the forward pass against the network in nn.py. I want you to finish implementing the ```MSE``` 
method so that it calculates the cost from the equation above.

I recommend using the ```np.square``` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.square.html)) 
method to make your life easier.

1. Check out nn.py to see how ```MSE``` will calculate the cost.
2. Open miniflow.py. Finish building ```MSE```.
3. Test your network! See if the cost makes sense given the inputs by playing with nn.py.
