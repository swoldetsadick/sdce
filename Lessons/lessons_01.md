### 5. Nanodegree Support

**Getting Support**

There are several ways in which you will receive support during the program from Udacity's network of Mentors and 
Reviewers, as well as your fellow students.

**Mentorship**

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/March/58d2bcc3_screen-shot-2017-03-22-at-11.04.30-am/screen-shot-2017-03-22-at-11.04.30-am.png)

Your in-classroom Mentor will be your guide through the program and will do the following:

* Check in with you weekly to make sure that you are on track.
* Help you set learning goals.
* Guide you to supplementary resources when you get stuck.
* Respond to any questions you have about the program.

If you have questions or comments about the Mentorship experience, or if you're having trouble reaching your mentor, 
please email `mentorship-support@udacity.com`

**Knowledge**

![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/June/5b205c0c_screen-shot-2018-06-12-at-4.42.50-pm/screen-shot-2018-06-12-at-4.42.50-pm.png)

Aside from your Mentor, Knowledge is a great place to ask in-depth and technical questions. Questions in Knowledge will 
be answered by both mentors and other students. Make sure to upvote good questions and answers as you read them, and 
feel free to post answers yourself!

![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/June/5b205c37_screen-shot-2018-06-12-at-4.42.45-pm/screen-shot-2018-06-12-at-4.42.45-pm.png)

You should be able to access Knowledge anytime by clicking on the lightbulb on the left hand side of the classroom. Once
 you are there, make sure to filter by your Nanodegree, and post a question (or answer!) if you have one!

**Slack Community**

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580ead6c_view/view.png)

Slack is the best place for live discussion and interaction with your community of students. If you haven't joined 
already, you can sign up [here](https://slackin.udacity.com/carnd). (Note that this Slack instance is for enrolled 
students and is different from the ND013 Slack Team.) There are many channels you can join after you sign up.

The Intro to Self-Driving Car and Self-Driving Car Engineer programs share one Slack workspace, so note that channels 
beginning with a #s- prefix are for this program, while channels beginning with a #i- are specific to the introductory 
program. Additionally, channels with a -p are for project-related discussion, while those without this marker are for 
course material-related discussion, separated by major content areas.

Make sure to introduce yourself in the #introductions channel when you first join!

**Reviews**

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580fa9af_review-screenshot/review-screenshot.png)

For each project you submit, you will receive detailed feedback from a project Reviewer.

Sometimes, a reviewer might ask you to resubmit a project to meet specifications. In that case, an indication of needed 
changes will also be provided. Note that you can submit a project as many times as needed to pass.

**Feedback**

![alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580ea4c5_waffle-yellow-on-blue/waffle-yellow-on-blue.png)

In order to keep our content up-to-date and address issues quickly, we've set up a 
[Waffle board](https://waffle.io/udacity/sdc-issue-reports) to track error reports and suggestions.

If you find an error, check there to see if it has already been filed. If it hasn't, you can file an issue by clicking 
on the "Add issue" button, adding a title, and entering a description in the details (you will need a GitHub account for
this).

Links and screenshots, if available, are always appreciated!

## 6. Career Support

[![Career Support](http://img.youtube.com/vi/4MGOyNXh4EQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4MGOyNXh4EQ "Career Support") 

**Connect to Hiring Partners through your Udacity Professional Profile**

In addition to the Career Lessons and Projects you'll find in your Nanodegree program, you have a Udacity Professional 
Profile, which can be accessed through your Career Portal. Once in the Career Portal, simply click on the "Edit Profile"
next to your name, and you will be taken to your Udacity Professional Profile:

![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b5b7f9e_screen-shot-2018-07-27-at-1.24.38-pm/screen-shot-2018-07-27-at-1.24.38-pm.png)

Your Udacity Professional Profile features important, professional information about yourself. When you make your 
profile public, it becomes accessible to our Hiring Partners.

Your profile will also connect you with recruiters and hiring managers who come to Udacity to hire skilled Nanodegree 
graduates.

As you complete projects in your Nanodegree program, they will be automatically added to your Udacity Professional 
Profile to ensure you're able to show employers the skills you've gained through the program. In order to differentiate
yourself from other candidates, make sure to go in and customize those project cards. In addition to these projects, be 
sure to:

* Keep your profile updated with your basic info and job preferences, such as location
* Ensure you upload your latest resume
* Return regularly to your Profile to update your projects and ensure you're showcasing your best work

If you are looking for a job, make sure to keep your Udacity Professional Profile updated and visible to recruiters!

## 7. Community Code of Conduct

**Community Code of Conduct**

Your experience in the Nanodegree program and community should be an engaging, fulfilling, and positive one. As such, 
we have outlined the following system for reporting behavior that does not live up to Udacity’s standards, so it can 
quickly be addressed by our staff.

All reports of suspected violations to the **TOU, Community Code of Conduct** or **Honor Code** should be submitted to 
`report@udacity.com` and will be reviewed. If you witness or are experiencing any violations of our policies please get 
in touch with us. Below are prohibited actions as set forth on our **Community Code of Conduct**:

* **Harassment**: Inappropriate, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or violent comments or conduct.
* **Discrimination**: Offensive comments related to gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, 
religion, national origin, disability or disease.
* **Distributing inappropriate content**: Use of sexual, violent, graphic, or derogatory images.
* **Bullying**: Deliberate intimidation, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* **Sexual harassment**: Unwelcome sexual attention .
* **Defamation**: Obscene, fraudulent, indecent, or libelous acts that defame, abuse, harass, discriminate against or 
threaten others.
* **Plagiarism**: will not cheat on any homework assignment, projects or exams for the Online Courses and, specifically,
will not plagiarize materials created by others.
* **Self-injury or Suicide**: We do not encourage community postings in Slack or Knowledge related to self-injury or 
suicide. If you or someone you know is exhibiting signs of self-injury or suicide, find help at the Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline in the U.S. and Befrienders.org globally.

When a potential violation is brought to our attention, we will make every effort to investigate the case thoroughly and
make a decision that is fair to all parties.

## 8. Deadline Policy

**Deadline Policy**
When we use the term “deadline” with regards to Nanodegree program projects, we use it in one of two ways:

* A final deadline for passing all projects
* Ongoing suggested deadline for individual projects

It is very important to understand the distinctions between the two, as your progress in the program is measured against
the deadlines we’ve established. Please see below for an explanation of what each usage means.

**A final deadline for passing all projects**
Passing a project in this context means that a Udacity Reviewer has marked your project as “Meets Specifications.” In 
order to graduate a term, you have to pass all projects by the last day of the term.

If you do not pass all projects by the last day of the term, the following happens:

* You will receive a 4-week extension to complete any outstanding projects. You will receive this extension a maximum of once per term. Once you submit and pass all projects, you can enroll in the next term, which will potentially be with a later class. If you do not submit and pass all projects within the 4-week extension, you will be removed from the program.

**Ongoing suggested deadlines for individual projects**

[!alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580d1499_screen-shot-2016-10-23-at-12.50.15-pm/screen-shot-2016-10-23-at-12.50.15-pm.png)

The deadlines you see in your classroom are suggestions for when you should ideally pass each project. They are meant to
help keep you on track so that you maintain an appropriate pace throughout the program—one that will see you graduate 
on time!

Please note that you can submit your project as many times as you need to. There are no penalties if you miss these 
deadlines. However, you will be at risk of not passing all projects on time if you miss these deadlines, and fall behind,
so it is a recommended best practice to try and meet each suggested deadline.

## 9. Class Schedule

**Staying on Track**

**Class Schedule**

Our class schedule PDF will help you stay on track to graduating. Remember, the suggested project deadlines are flexible
but the end of term deadline is not. In order to graduate, you will need to pass all projects by the final end of term 
deadline. If you fall behind the suggested project deadlines, you can use the class schedule to prioritize which lessons
are most relevant to completing the projects before your term ends. Note that you are free to work ahead of the class 
schedule. You may view and download the class schedule [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/udacity-email/Documents/SDC+Weekly+Syllabus+-+March+2018+Class.pdf).

## 10. Rating your career confidence

**Rating Your Career Confidence**

One area we'd love to hear from you on is how the Nanodegree impacts your career confidence. As such, please let us know
how you feel about your current confidence below, and we'll check back in with you near the end of the program to hear 
how you've progressed!

## 11. Self-driving car history

**Self-Driving Car History**

[!alt text](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580ea373_stanley/stanley.jpg)

The recent advancements in self-driving cars are built on decades of work by people around the world.

In the next video, you'll get a chance to step back and learn about some of this work and how your own contributions may
one day fit into this narrative.

In particular, you'll get a chance to relive the DARPA Grand Challenge, one of the great milestones in self-driving car 
technology, and meet some of the people who took on this seemingly impossible task.

This video is not required, but we highly encourage you to watch it when you get the chance.

We hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
