Your Udacity Professional Profile features important, professional information about yourself. When you make your 
profile public, it becomes accessible to our Hiring Partners.

Your profile will also connect you with recruiters and hiring managers who come to Udacity to hire skilled Nanodegree 
graduates.

As you complete projects in your Nanodegree program, they will be automatically added to your Udacity Professional 
Profile to ensure you're able to show employers the skills you've gained through the program. In order to differentiate 
yourself from other candidates, make sure to go in and customize those project cards. In addition to these projects, 
be sure to:

* Keep your profile updated with your basic info and job preferences, such as location
* Ensure you upload your latest resume
* Return regularly to your Profile to update your projects and ensure you're showcasing your best work

If you are looking for a job, make sure to keep your Udacity Professional Profile updated and visible to recruiters!
